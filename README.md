# RedCloud

## Requirements

If you're on macos, you'll need to have python installed.
It comes installed by default, so you're probably okay,
however, to check, run `python -v`.
Any 2.7 or 3.x version will work, not 4.0 and up.

```shell
npm install # to install dependencies
npm start # recompile and run production mode
npm run production # just run production, dont recompile
npm run dev # recompile on the fly, and start (with cron jobs paused)
```
